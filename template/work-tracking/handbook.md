# Work-tracking handbook

Copied from work-tracking-system at <commit> on <YYMMDD>

How to keep the [dashboard](dashboard.md) and topic files useful. The dashboard says what to do. Topics remember why.

Before acting on a free-text answer or an answer inferred from the project, state how you interpreted it. Treat an inferred answer as a proposal and get the dev's approval before using it.

## Start a session

1. Read **Start here** on the dashboard: Do now, Decisions you owe, Inbox, In flight.
2. Go through the Inbox. For each line, say what to do: make a row, drop it with a reason, or keep it. If the Inbox passes about 15 lines, say so once.
3. Open the topic for the item you work on. Read **At a glance** first. Read the rest only when you need it.
4. Skip the archive unless a link sends you there.

## Who owns what

| Fact | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Status, priority, who, size, do after, next action | Dashboard row |
| Ideas not yet reviewed | Dashboard Inbox |
| Dropped and rejected ideas, with reasons | Dashboard closed lookup |
| Goal, done when, work tree, findings, decisions, evidence, notes | Topic |
| Research and planning sources | `notes/`. Read only when a topic links to one |
| Project behavior | Project documentation |
| Old history | Archive, if the project has one |

Link to the owner. Don't copy. Topics never state status.

Do now lists the Next rows in order. When a row's status or next action changes, update Do now in the same edit, and refresh the 'Updated' date at the top of the dashboard.

## Statuses and priority

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔜 | Next | Chosen to do soon. Has a tagged next action |
| 🔨 | Active | Work is underway |
| 📋 | Backlog | Worth doing, not chosen yet |
| ⏳ | Waiting | Blocked on a named thing ("waits for ...") |
| 💤 | Deferred | Paused until a named trigger |
| ✅ | Done | Done-when criteria met |
| ❌ | Dropped | Decided against |
| ↪️ | Superseded | Another item replaced it |

**Next means chosen to do soon. It does not approve implementation or Git actions.** Keep Next short (1-5) and ordered.

Priority is High, Medium or Low, shown after the status. Use the project's recorded rules. Otherwise use these defaults:

- **High:** Blocks use or risks wrong results.
- **Medium:** Improves current work or tooling.
- **Low:** Wishlist work.

Use the highest matching level. "Quick win" is an optional marker.

Priority rules: kit defaults, not confirmed

## Tags, who and size

| Tag | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `[idea]` | A possible feature or change |
| `[research]` | Find something out, test, measure, compare |
| `[build]` | Change code or docs |
| `[question]` | Needs a decision or answer from the dev |

The same tags prefix every Next action. Type describes the whole item. The tag on the next action describes that step. **Who** is you (the dev), agent or both. **Size:** S under half a day, M about a day, L several days. The agent proposes who and size; the dev confirms.

## Inbox

One line per idea, newest at the bottom:

`YYMMDD [idea] Add a helpful project feature (from: agent)`

- No ID, status or priority. Append only.
- Reread the Inbox right before you add a line. Two agents sometimes run at once.
- A [question] that blocks the next step also goes in Do now.
- A line leaves the Inbox when you make it a WI row, drop it (closed lookup), or answer it.

### Closing an item

- Done needs two things: the Done-when criteria are met, and the dev says so. Don't close an item on your own. When the criteria look met, say so in your reply and ask.
- Finishing the work you were asked to do is not closing. Set it Waiting for the dev's acceptance, say what to check, and ask.
- "Approve" or "looks good" about a plan or an approach doesn't mean close. If unsure, ask.
- When the dev confirms, do this in one edit: set Done on the row; record the outcome and date in the topic; remove it from Do now and refresh the Updated date; update the parent's Work tree and progress line if it has one; answer or remove its Inbox lines, noting where each went; leave open children open and say so in your reply.

## Capture check

- After a prompt that produced something worth keeping (an idea, finding, decision or status change), update tracking. Skip the update for plain Q&A.
- If you find something worth keeping during read-only work, propose the Inbox line in your reply and let the dev say yes.
- Put the Tracking line only on the last message of a turn, not on progress notes.

| What happened | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| New idea, bug, question, research topic | Inbox line |
| Status or next action changed | Dashboard row |
| Finding, decision, rejected approach, evidence limit | Topic |
| Detour resolved part of the goal | A note on how this got back to the goal in the topic |

End every reply, including plain Q&A, with a Tracking line. Use `Tracking: updated WI-NNN (what)` for an item's tracking, `Tracking: updated <file> (what)` for tracking edits no WI owns, such as handbook or dashboard-only changes, or `Tracking: no change`. Name every WI and file you updated, separated by `; `. Put it on the last line of the reply, or just above the `Evidence:` line when that line is present. The line also shows that AGENTS.md loaded.

### Completion check

Tracking is part of finishing the task. Before reporting completion:

1. Identify the WI that owns the work. If the work started in the Inbox, give completed work a dashboard row.
2. Reconcile the row and any topic with what actually happened: outcome, status, remaining work, decisions and evidence limits. Keep short outcomes in the row; use a topic when more detail is needed.
3. Record an Inbox line's outcome or destination before removing it. Completed work stays in a Done row, rejected work goes in the closed lookup, and answered questions go with the item they concern.
4. Separate unresolved follow-ups from completed work. Use the existing child-item rules for new tasks. Don't leave a completed parent open because independent work remains.
5. Reread the updated entries against the code, validation results and approved scope. Make sure the final reply's `Tracking:` line names the actual updates.
6. After any tracking edit, list the lines you changed in the reply.
7. If you commit after running this check, run steps 2 and 5 again.

If tracking can't be updated, report the task as incomplete and explain why. For read-only work, respect the no-edit boundary and report any tracking updates still needed.

### Pausing work

When you stop before the work is done (the dev says "pause" or "stop here", or the chat ends), don't run the Completion check. Instead:

1. Update the dashboard row and Do now for anything that changed.
2. Write or refresh the Resume point in the topic: where you stopped, what's unfinished, and what the next agent does first. Items with no topic need only the row.
3. Say in your reply what is done and what remains.

A paused item keeps its status (usually 🔨 Active). Pausing is an action, not a status.

## Rabbit holes

When work on one item turns up new work, make each new piece a **child WI**. Don't grow the parent's row.

A small child needs only its indented row, with 'Part of WI-NNN' at the start of its description. The parent's topic holds the detail. Give a child its own topic only if it needs one.

| Field | Where | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Part of | Child description; topic first line if it has one; child row indented under parent | Exactly one parent |
| Do after | Dashboard row and parent work tree | Items that must finish first |
| Related | Dashboard links column | Optional |
| Size, type | Dashboard row and work tree | S/M/L, one tag |

If a child has its own topic, its first line is: `Part of WI-NNN, found while working on: <parent goal>`.

The parent topic keeps its **Original goal** and a **Work tree**. The tree lists order, link, type, size and do-after. It does not repeat status. Refresh its single progress line whenever a child changes.

The Work tree copies type, size and do-after from the dashboard. Update both in the same edit.

Example with made-up IDs:

```text
## Work tree
Progress as of YYMMDD: 1 of 3 done

| # | Item                                      | Type       | Size | Do after |
| 1 | WI-901 Check the current project behavior  | [research] | S    | -        |
| 2 | WI-902 Implement the agreed change         | [build]    | M    | WI-901   |
| 3 | WI-903 Choose a follow-up approach         | [question] | S    | WI-901   |
```

On the dashboard, children sit under the parent with `↳`. When the tree is done, add a note on how this got back to the goal and check the parent's Done when.

## Filing agent output

When the dev decides to act on agent output, file it once:

1. Put the short version (findings, decisions) in the topic's main sections.
2. Put the full text under **Notes** at the bottom: `### <YYMMDD> - one-line summary`, newest first.
3. When Notes get long or the item closes, merge them into Current understanding and trim.

Don't paste routine command output, test totals or transcripts.

## Topic layout

Name topic files `WI-NNN-short-name.md`, with uppercase `WI`, a three-digit ID, and a short descriptive name.

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| At a glance | About 15 lines: goal, tree progress, decisions made, next step, work in progress right now. No status words; the dashboard owns status |
| Original goal | The agreed outcome. Change it only by a recorded decision |
| Done when | Checkable criteria |
| Work tree | Parent topics only: the ordered list of child items |
| Current understanding | A summary of what we know now, not a diary. Use evidence labels: documented, inferred from source, observed here, from past chat, unknown |
| Decisions and tradeoffs | Choices, rejected options, reasons |
| Findings and outcomes | Results, gotchas, notes on how this got back to the goal |
| Resume point | Optional while Active: where you stopped. Delete when it closes |
| References | Links to code, docs, commits, evidence |
| Notes | Filed agent output, dated |

### Evidence labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Documented | Stated in project documentation or another named source of truth. |
| Inferred from source | Read from code at a named commit, not run. |
| Observed here | Seen in a test or probe run during this work. |
| From past chat | Taken from an earlier chat session. Give the date and a one-line summary, not the text. Another agent can't recheck it, so confirm it in the repo or with the dev before relying on it. |
| Unknown | Not checked or not available. |

Omit empty sections. No hard size cap; review a topic around 4,000 words. Older topics gain At a glance the next time they are edited.

## Scale the effort

| Kind | Record |
| --- | --- |
| Idea | One Inbox line |
| Task | One dashboard row |
| Research | Topic with evidence labels |
| Done | Outcome plus gotchas in the row or topic |

## Stable rules

- Each dashboard row starts with `<a name="wi-NNN"></a>**WI-NNN** Title`.
- WI IDs are never reused. Gaps are fine. Each row keeps its `wi-NNN` anchor when it moves.
- Dropped ideas get one line with the reason in the closed lookup, so nobody proposes them again.
- When you migrate a topic, add a one-line Closed lookup entry for each rejected approach another agent might propose again, linked to the topic. At most three per topic.
- Reread an entry before you edit it, and keep other chats' changes. Ask if two edits conflict.
- Keep personal paths, real session IDs and credentials out of tracking files. Missing evidence stays labeled missing.
- Don't record commit state (uncommitted, committed, under review) in tracking; Git shows it. Name a commit hash only as evidence after it exists.
- The archive is old history. Nothing new goes there. Read it only through links.
